Greetings! My name is Livian Von Dran, though most call me Liv for short. I'm an analytical biology professional who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of South Florida in 2023. At present, I am enrolled in the University of Colorado Boulder's Earth Data Analytics Professional Graduate Certificate program. I am currently affiliated with a few different non-profits; I serve as an entomologist at The Spring Institute for Forests on the Moon, and I am a grant writer and science communicator for Interstellar Research Group. I recently graduated from Blue Marble Space Institute of Science's Young Scientist Program and am transitioning into the Visiting Scholars Program, where I will be researching astroentomology under Dr. Graham Lau. I hope to take advantage of these research experiences during the graduate school admissions process, where I hope to study the applications of entomology to astrobiology, space biology, space ecology, and space exploration.  

I was born in England, though I have lived in numerous states courtesy of being an Air Force military brat. Most of my childhood was spent in Florida, but I have also lived in Montana and Colorado. I have wanted to work with animals since I was young, and this desire influenced me to pursue biology. I briefly attended Western Colorado University, and I fell in love with space when a friend took me to the Gunnison Valley Observatory; there, I saw the celestial arms of the Milky Way decorating the ethereal night. My interest in entomology—and subsequently, my interest in moths—started after I graduated; I got into documenting wildlife sightings on iNaturalist, and my interest in insects grew as I documented the multitude of species present in the United States.

<ins>My Interest in  Earth Data Analytics</ins>

I am excited to participate in CU Boulder's Earth Data Analytics program for two reasons: I am interested in learning Python and data analysis for research purposes, and I am eager to learn more about earth science. A recent literature I conducted indicated there is not enough evidence to conclude if light pollution is impacting moths at a population level due to, in part, significant heterogeneity and regional biases in the spatiotemporal data of moth populations. I hope to develop the expertise needed to alleviate this data scarcity.
